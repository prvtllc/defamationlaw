### Why This Project
The Internet has brought up an opportunity for free expression.  The balance between the First Amendment and reputational rights is constanly tested in the Courts.  This site was created to bring awareness to the laws of each jurisdiction, how are they being interpreted, and how they differ from each other.  

### Who Created This Project
This project was created by attorney [Domingo J Rivera](https://www.icyberlaw.com) and [AVM Technology](http://www.infosecusa.com).  Mr. Rivera and AVM Technology consult with attorneys in investigations related to Internet defamation cases. The combination of knowledge of the law as well as technical expertise is applied to create a value added service for attorneys and law firms.
